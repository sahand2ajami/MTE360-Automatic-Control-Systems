# MTE360-Automatic-Control-Systems

This repository contains the lab content for MTE/ME360-Automatic Control (taught in University of Waterloo), focusing on the Quanser Flexible Cart system. The labs are designed to provide hands-on experience with control system design and implementation using MATLAB and Simulink.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- MATLAB (R2021a or later)
- Simulink
- Control System Toolbox
- Quanser Hardware Support Package (for real-time implementation)

## Lab Content
The repository is structured as follows:
- `Lab1/`: Introduction to Simulink for control system design
  - system identification through step response measurement
- `Lab2/`: Modeling and simulation of the Quanser Flexible Cart system.
- `Lab3/`: Design and implementation of PID controllers for the Quanser Flexible Cart.
- `Lab4/`: Advanced control strategies for the Quanser Flexible Cart (e.g., state-space control, LQR).

Each lab folder contains:
- `Instructions.pdf`: Detailed lab instructions and theoretical background.
- `SimulinkModels/`: Pre-built Simulink models for the lab exercises.
